# Flat Assembler (FASM) System Call Macros

This repository contains some simple macros for basic system calls in Linux using Flat Assembler (FASM). It’s an experiment to get hands-on experience with low-level programming and system calls.

## Current Macros:
- **write**: Write data to `stdout`.
- **exit**: Exit the program with a given exit code.
- **read**: Read input from `stdin`.

## Purpose
This is just an exploration of how system calls work and how to simplify them using macros in FASM. It’s not meant to be a fully polished library—just a fun experiment!
